## 🧰 Working with Techno Debuggers Repositories



## SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) 💡
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a process used by software teams to design, develop, and test high-quality software. It ensures that all software products meet customer expectations and are completed within time and cost estimates.

---

 ## 🔁 SDLC Phases
Requirement Analysis → Gather and analyze client needs

Planning → Define project scope, cost, and schedule

Design → Create software architecture and interface designs

Development → Write and integrate the actual code

Testing → Verify software against requirements and fix bugs

Deployment → Deliver the finished product to users

Maintenance → Perform updates and improvements post-deployment
